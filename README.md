# OLOD
OLOD: A New UAV Dataset and Benchmark for Single Tiny Object Tracking

![tmp1](img/tmp1.png)

#### *Intro*

:airplane: OLOD, which is the first benchmark test designed specifically for drone tracking and dedicated to a comprehensive evaluation of tiny object tracking performance, aims to establish a standardized assessment. It consists of over 55.5k manually annotated frames, making it suitable for large-scale evaluations. The benchmark includes a total of 55,473 frames, with an average of 793 frames per sequence, ranging from 319 frames to a maximum of 1,353 frames. The videos were recorded at a frame rate of 30 frames per second (FPS) with a resolution of 3840*2160. The average duration of each video segment is 26.42 seconds, indicating relatively longer video sequences.



#### *Data*
